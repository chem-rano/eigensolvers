This is specifically for checking overlap data of Eigen ion.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Contains overlap folders
(A) unsorted/    :: Generated from old overlap code
(B) sorted/     :: (i) sorted with correct_overlapOrder.py -> nornorthogonal Ref
(C) nonortho/  :: Generated from overlap.py -> nonorthogonal Ref
(D) ortho/      :: Generated from overlap.py -> orthogonal Ref
(E) ortho_using_saved_overlap/ :: Generated from overlap.py using saved overlap (iii)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Contains three scripts

(i) check_accordanceREF.py :: Test for accordanceREF.py -> Successful
Two codes sorted reference in two ways. Agreement confirms the order is correct.
Result is stored in check_accordanceREF.out. Explicitly looked for duplicates - no
duplicate found.

(ii) check_correct_overlapOrder.py :: Test for correct_overlapOrder.py -> Successful
Result is stored in check_correct_overlapOrder.out.

(iii) check_overlap.py :: Test for overlap.py -> Successful
Note: Orthogonal checking tolerance is high -> as E calculated w rounded data
It checks files from folders (listed above): B == C & D == E
